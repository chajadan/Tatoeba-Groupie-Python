REM	This is a fully commented out batch file.
REM	It is expected to be used only on windows operating systems.
REM	To use this file, remove "REM" from one of the last three lines. The following helps you choose which one.
REM	If python version 3 is on your path, the simplest last line is fine.
REM	Otherwise, you need to use a full path to the python executable, something like "C:\python33\python.exe" or similar.
REM	If you installed python 3.3 in the default location, the second to last line can be un "REM"'d.
REM	Otherwise, you must supply a valid path that points to your python.exe version 3.x executable, using the third to last line.
REM	When using the third to last line, it is expected that you will need to edit the line in addition to removing "REM"
REM	If the full path to python contains a space, the path must be quoted, as shown below, third to last.
REM	if the full path to python does not contain any spaces, there should be no quotes around the path, as shown below, second to last.
REM	You can make a shortcut to this bat file on your desktop or other location, and launch Tatoeba Groupie by double clicking it.
